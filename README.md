### 👋 Hi! I'm Joan

💡 Passionate about C++, OpenGL, and game architecture.  

🛠️ Technologies I use:  
C++ | C# | OpenGL | SDL | Unity | Unreal | Git | ImGui 

🎮 Featured Projects:
- **Runic2D** – Lightweight 2D engine designed with modularity and performance in mind
- **Hawk Engine** – Custom 3D engine with editor, scripting, UI, PBR rendering, and more
- **Blood & Thunder** – Top-down action game built using Hawk Engine, set in the Warhammer 40K universe

🎯 I’ve also participated in several game jams and side projects, including titles like Racing Car, Skyfox, Fishy Feast, among others.
